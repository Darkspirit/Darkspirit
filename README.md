    * Fat -> liver -> ketone bodies as energy
    * saturated fatty acids
      * pro-inflammatory
      * rather solid at room temperature
      * land animal fat
      * 80-90% of coconut oil (vegetarian butter, cheese)
    * unsaturated fatty acids
      * monounsaturated fatty acids
        * Omega-9
          * anti-inflammatory
          * oleic acid

            * Linseed/Flaxseed oil for cold cooking (Must not be used for frying, otherwise harmful substances can form.)
            * Colza/Rape oil for frying (but also contains Omega-6)
          * EPA
            * for brain, eyes, heart, skin
            * capsules with EPA+DHA from Schizochytrium microalgae
              * alternative: sardines

        * Omega 6
          * If too much: pro-inflammatory
  * Protein
    * Amino acids
    * If too much -> becomes sugar -> insuline goes up -> sugar becomes body fat
    * If too little -> muscles are consumed
  * Carbohydrates
    * Indigestible carbohydrates (called fiber)
    * Digestible carbohydrates (the actual Carbohydrates)
      * Carbohydrates become sugar -> insuline goes up -> sugar becomes body fat
  * Sugar
    * Sugar -> insuline goes up -> sugar becomes body fat
  * Minerals
    * Salt
      * rises blood pressure: vascular damage. risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases
